### The Mind, Crypto and AI in four systems

#### **A holistic view of large systems of networks**

  

  

**System 0, System 1, System 2, System 3**

What is the evolution of Crypto and AI in the next three years? Here can be a map of that.

Large complex systems of networks such as the mind and the now developing AI and Crypto can be viewed to be constituted of four systems. This essay draws shared similarities between the mind, Crypto and AI in reference to this view.

The use of system 1 and system 2 terminology was first discovered reading the book “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman. In this post I will adopt two more terms, system 0 and system 3 necessary to depict a complete view.

Unlike the book by Daniel, this post has not much of a scientific method when reaching conclusions. Driven by intuition it finds interest to map out in plain language the evolution and progress of these technologies.

**In Crypto**, system 0 would provide the basic functions and security, including for instance the networks for proof of work and distributed ledger, primary reward system and low-level routing. Concrete implementations of these, would be for instance the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin token pricing, Polkadot blockchain. System 1 would include the networks for smart contracts, automated market maker and many of the creations being built with Ethereum and other layer 1 blockchains. The development of system 2 began seriously only in the last one or two years and it had the initiative to create networks aimed at scaling the transaction throughput while taking advantage of the robust decentralised security model of system 1. System 2 will enable developers to explore countless applications of newly digitised values being written in system1. System 3 exists to provide the technology for scalable proof of access and permanent storage.

_Therefore Crypto is a living machine with Bitcoin being only one important subsystem of it._

We have proof of work, proof of stake, proof of validity and proof of access; these however don’t apply one to one with the four systems as in the case of the Polkadot protocol adopting proof of stake while it is still considered part of system 0.

**_There are dualities_** between the four systems, this aspect in particular applies well to system 1 since we could claim that alone it presents all the functions and advantages of the other systems. In reality it is less versatile — adaptable or can be adapted on many different functions or activities, so it will not make it by itself in a non-secure environment. But this, what I refer to as dualistic propriety, makes it possible to integrate with other systems to complement it. Under this view Crypto in its final stages of development may resemble a living organism for its dynamism. If one part of the network is hit, the rest will come to rescue. These characteristics make possible a harmonic combination of the four to form one single versatile and robust system.

**_In modern AI_**, system 0 is yet to be developed. It can be surprising to some as it feels to be a necessary part in order to build upon it and yet it’s not necessary because each system of the four has a distinctive nature and an overall independent function. In artificial entities there is no necessity of building one before the other. However, with hindsight in the case of Crypto building system 0 at first has turned out to be crucial.

In AI almost everyone seemed to support the idea of creating artificial intelligence. From here, the majority of scientists backed by the security of existing institutions have found more interest to work on system 1. In Crypto ideas of its success have been quite controversial among many which certainly have challenged its existence; therefore, if it wasn’t for system 0 innovative power and simplicity in design, system 1 might not have been developed that quickly, if developed at all. But kudos to the early believers.

**_In our mind_**, system 0 existence is to provide the basic functions, security and the primary reward subsystem. In the brain it would be represented for instance by the brainstem, amygdala, thalamus. System 1 existence is to allow us to learn world models through associative memories, presented with different networks depending on the type of data. An implementation of this in the brain would be the parietal lobe, occipital lobe and part of the temporal lobe. System 2 existence is for reasoning, self-control, meta-cognition and executive functions, this entails for instance simulations and planning. And it is represented by the frontal lobe. System 2 creates a playground out of the mind. The playground is not in system 2 but in the other three systems, **likewise in crypto and AI**. System 3 existence is to provide a declarative memory with functions such as memory indexing and long-term storage. In the brain we find this happening for instance in the hippocampus.

There could be a doubt that system 0 is distant or has little to do with system 3 only because of this terminology adoption. That’s however not the case, the terms don’t speak on the degree of interaction between the four systems. Take for instance the case of how in the brain, the thalamus (system 0) has many connections to the hippocampus (system 3).

In humans, as we age somehow it feels easier to manage nature than to learn about nature. We tend to become more selective than receptive. This may be a sign of advanced development of system 2, but to certain degrees this shouldn’t hold us from being the other way around.

The prefrontal cortex is fully developed around the age of 25, so it is till then that we most require the guidance of other adults to compensate for the functions otherwise performed by system 2.

**_The largest modern AI_** development has been dedicated to system 1. With the AlexNet model making its way through the ImageNet challenge in 2012, setting a new paradigm on visual information processing. Transformer based models had an equivalent impact with language and speech. So what is coming next is that we are moving toward the integration between different networks within system 1 resulting in the valuable multi-modal propriety. This propriety in AI becomes essential for the ability to imagine as humans do.

Now if system 1’s function is to abstract or digitalise a base reality with all its modalities and create a model out of it, system 2 will contribute to validate this reality model, plus it will use this to discover new possible models that we couldn’t otherwise perceive.

There are a few states of meditation where merely observing system 1 generating visual or language answers may convey the sense of sublimity. Some of those who have experienced these mind states, dazzled by the degree of alignment of these responses with the learned world model, may have described and shared their experience as being in contact with a divinity.

Currently in AI there is a trend to build very large language models. But at the end, for instance in the evolution of the nervous system, we saw how elephants’ brains hold something like 257 billion neurons, yet humans with only 86 billion had much greater impact in overcoming challenges and discovering the surrounding reality.

**_Two recent_**  data science publications have caught my attention when it comes to officially setting the direction of progress toward system 3 and system 2, these are: RETRO from DeepMind in December 2021 and InstructGPT from OpenAI in January 2022. Both genuinely claim to have achieved better quality results than previous very large language models like GPT-3 and this is despite their models being close to 4% GPT-3 size. That is a milestone in information efficiency. This slight touch with s2 and s3 produced the scent of consciousness. And not by coincidence this sparked some questions within the AI community on social media. Right implementations of system 2 and system 3 in AI are not there yet but the research being done on graph neural networks will most likely be part of it.

A **_formal_** definition of **_consciousness_** that can be constructive to all the arts and sciences will have to wait a few more years for further development in AI. This indeed will unveil the inner working mechanisms of concepts which are prior to this phenomenon in a way that everyone can see and agree on. A condition to consciousness comes when system 2 and system 3 are properly integrated with the other two systems. A prior to consciousness is an entity whose description would recall that of an agent with states, capable of interacting with many networks.

**_Imagination & synthesis_**— When we have an inner conversation, that is the agent in system 2 moderating it; in fact, this agent can induce the generation of language or visual simulations in system 1, query system 3 for specific knowledge, use the logical properties of system 2 and it can keep this inner discourse for an indefinite time. What could be amusing to think about is how system 2 — the frontal lobe, stands at the front of our heads, presenting us to the outside world and requiring its ability to consciously speak, interact with people. Similarly when we interact with a website we are dealing with the front end of it.

If system 1 is characterised with learning, exploration will be the domain of system 2. In our mind it feels we are rewarded when we discover new categories, establish the attributes of these categories, discover and establish the relations. This reward policy may have evolved over a long period of time in the human mind. But in general our ability to conveniently sample and design new reward policies is the domain of system 2.

**Projections**, It could be called differently but an important component is the concept of projections when it comes to designing the integration between the four systems. These are not intended only as connections between spaces but it’s also the processing of a particular information from one region to another of different dynamics. In relation to our context, projections exist between different systems (vertical) or within the same (horizontal).

Example projections in the brain and crypto:

-   The ventral pathway — Visual processing between the occipital lobe and the inferior temporal lobe — Horizontal projection.
-   Bitcoin — Transactions processing between the Bitcoin blockchain and the lightning network — Vertical projection

  

Sometimes I may even refer to projections in an abstract form. For instance we could say that routing as a concept is projected in all the four systems. Modules in system 0 will be routing different types of information to different parts of the network to be processed and that is equivalent to what the thalamus in the brain does. Routing in system 1 may be locally built-in within the networks to enable a few advantages. System 2 with its privileged sight on high-order concepts will also be routing globally. System 3 may be holding metadata records of possible routing paths.

**_Fast and Slow_ **— For those who came across the book, Think Fast and Slow, an explanation may be required to remove the sense of contradiction when comparing claims on the processing speed attributed to system 2 between the mind and crypto. Mind’s system 2 has been associated with slow computation while crypto’s system 2 is designed to enable fast transactions and higher throughput.

When the mind is given a puzzle, system 2 will be performing many operations to solve this but the output results may be much fewer in number which makes it appear slow. Likewise in crypto, an application can be performing thousands of transactions off-chain, but settle much fewer transactions representing the results on the blockchain. These intermediate transactions occurring on the lightning network — system 2, are referred to as commitment transactions and are cheap because of being processed off-chain while settling transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain — system 0, which has a capacity of 3–7 TPS is more expensive.

Therefore strictly speaking, mind’s system 2 is not slow but its ability for instance to perform multiple sequential operations before reaching a conclusion, makes it appear as such.

In conclusion, knowledge on large networks at some degree of abstraction can be transferred between these technologies. The next three years will see development in the individual systems and many of the integrations between these.

Given that “the prefrontal cortex is highly interconnected with much of the brain”, presenting a high-order routing mechanism, will this also become true in the system 2 networks of Crypto?
