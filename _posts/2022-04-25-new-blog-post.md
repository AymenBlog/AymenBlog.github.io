# The Mind, Crypto and AI in four systems


A holistic view of large systems of networks


System 0, System 1, System 2, System 3

What is the evolution of Crypto and AI in the next three years? Here can be a map of that.
Large complex systems of networks such as the mind and the now developing AI and Crypto can be viewed to be constituted of four systems. This essay draws shared similarities between the mind, Crypto and AI in reference to this view.
The use of system 1 and system 2 terminology was first discovered reading the book “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman. In this post I will adopt two more terms, system 0 and system 3 necessary to depict a complete view.
Unlike the book by Daniel, this post has not much of a scientific method when reaching conclusions. Instead driven by intuition it finds interest to map out in plain language the evolution and progress of these technologies.
In Crypto, system 0 would provide the basic functions and security, including for instance the networks for proof of work and distributed ledger, low-level routing and primary reward system. Concrete implementations of these, would be for instance the Bitcoin blockchain, Polkadot interoperability. System 1 would include the networks for smart contracts, automated market maker and many of the creations being built with Ethereum and other layer 1 blockchains. The development of system 2 began seriously only in the last one or two years and it had the initiative to create networks aimed at scaling the transaction throughput while taking advantage of the robust decentralised security model of system 1. System 2 will enable developers to explore countless applications of newly digitised values being written in system1. System 3 exists to provide the technology for scalable proof of access and permanent storage.
Therefore Crypto will be seen as a living machine with Bitcoin being only one important subsystem of it.
